In React.js, a callback function is a function that is passed as a parameter to another function or component. It's used to allow one component to communicate with or trigger actions in another component. Callback functions are commonly used in scenarios like handling events, passing data between parent and child components, and managing asynchronous operations.
callback functions like event handlers inside a component are re-created as unique function objects at every re-render of the component.
